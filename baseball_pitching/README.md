# OBP Documentation (Baseball Pitching)

# C3D

Cleaned C3D files are provided at `~\baseball_pitching\data\c3d` for those who wish to conduct their own analysis process from start to finish. C3Ds are separated into athlete-specific folders with static model files also provided.

## File Naming

All C3Ds follow a common naming convention. 

`USERid_SESSIONid_HEIGHT_WEIGHT_PITCHNUMBER_PITCHTYPE_PITCHSPEED.c3d`

`USERid` = unique athlete identifier

`SESSIONid` = unique session identifier

`HEIGHT` = body height in inches (body height in meters is also provided in the metadata CSV)

`WEIGHT` = bodyweight in pounds (body mass in kilograms is also provided in the metadata CSV)

`PITCHNUMBER` = pitch number from the athlete’s assessment

`PITCHTYPE` = type of pitch thrown

- FF = fastball

`PITCHSPEED` = speed of the pitch thrown in miles per hour to one decimal place (with the decimal place removed)

- ex. `~_905.c3d` would be a pitch speed of 90.5 mph; `~_950.c3d` would be a pitch speed of 95.0 mph

## Force Plates

Ground reaction force data were collected using three force plates embedded underneath the pitching mound turf surface (average turf thickness ~ 0.5 inches).

## Global Coordinate System

The global (laboratory) reference frame is such that (+) x points from second base towards home plate, (+) y points towards first base, and (+) z points upward

# Full Signal

We first calculate joint angles, velocities, forces, and moments according to the right hand rule. We then perform select adjustments to better match coach/player intuition (righty/lefty symmetry, sign negations, adding or subtracting 90 degrees, etc.). Forces and Moments are internal forces and moments.

Below is a list of joint mechanics, their components, and conventions. Where joint kinematics are constrained by the model, corresponding kinetic conventions are provided. 

## Processed Joint Kinematic/Kinetic Conventions

Processed full signal data were filtered with a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20.0 Hz.

## Processed Ground Reaction Force Conventions

Ground reaction force data were filtered with a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40.0 Hz

| Force Plate | X | Y | Z |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FP1/3 | + = Braking (Posterior) | + = Lateral | + = Superior |
| FP2 | + = Push off (Anterior) | + = Lateral | + = Superior |

## Table Schema

Full signal data are broken up into six large CSV files:

- `energy_flow`: energy transfer, energy generation, energy absorption
- `force_plate`: rear leg, lead leg ground reaction forces
- `forces_moments`: joint forces, joint moments
- `joint angles`: joint angles
- `joint_velos`: joint angular velocities
- `landmarks`: joint center positions

Tables may be joined using `session_pitch` + `time`. Please note that force plate and marker-derived data are provided at their own respective measurement rates (1,080 Hz and 360 Hz, respectively). Therefore, we recommend caution when joining force plate and marker-derived data to avoid potential data loss.

The times at which common events occurred are also joined in each table for convenience. Provided events are foot contact (10% bodyweight), foot plant (100% bodyweight), maximum external rotation (layback), ball release, and maximum internal rotation.

By default, forces and moments are expressed in the proximal segment’s coordinate system (ex. `lead_ankle_moment_x` represents the moment at the lead ankle about the shank’s x-axis). Exceptions are made for the forces and moments at the shoulders and hips. For these joints, two sets of forces and two sets of moments are provided. The first set is the joint force/moment resolved in the proximal segment’s coordinate system (ex. shoulder force along the thorax’s x, y, and z axes). The second set is the joint force/moment resolved in the distal segment’s coordinate system (ex. shoulder force along the upper arm’s x, y, and z axes). For these “double dipped” joint kinetics, we follow the naming convention `joint_referenceSegment_kineticType_element`. For example, `shoulder_upper_arm_moment_z` represents the moment at the shoulder about the upper arm’s longitudinal (z) axis and `shoulder_thorax_moment_z` represents the moment at the shoulder resolved about the thorax superior-inferior (z) axis.

One potential research project is to process the provided C3D using your own pipeline and compare your results with ours. Self-processed data from C3D files may be linked to the provided full signal data through the metadata CSV located at `~\baseball_pitching\data\metadata.csv`.
